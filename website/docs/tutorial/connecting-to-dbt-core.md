## Choose the way you want to develop

Thereâ€™s two main ways of working with dbt:

1. Edit files and run projects using the web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in **dbt Cloud**.
2. Edit files locally using a code editor, and run projects using the Command Line Interface (**dbt CLI**).

To use the CLI, it's important that you know some basics of your terminal. In particular, you should understand `cd`, `ls` and `pwd` to navigate through the directory structure of your computer easily. As such, if you are new to programming, we recommend using **dbt Cloud** for this tutorial.

If you wish to use the CLI, please follow the [installation instructions](/dbt-cli/install/overview) for your operating system.
